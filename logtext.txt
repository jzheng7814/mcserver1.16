[15:04:12] [Server thread/INFO]: Cognizar joined the game
[15:04:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yo
[15:05:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> crops have been flooded by the water stream from the thing up top
[15:05:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> that shouldnt happen
[15:05:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> is that you flying around up there
[15:05:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> yeah im trying to debug this thing
[15:05:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> its not working properly
[15:05:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> also doesnt that block sunlight up there
[15:05:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> crops wont grow?
[15:05:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> torches still provide light, game only checks light levels
[15:05:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ah ok
[15:06:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> did you happen to time set day
[15:06:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah
[15:06:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> FUCK
[15:06:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh did the screw smth
[15:06:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> these villagers need a sleep cycle or else the golems dont spawn
[15:06:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> also im playing w trackpad so like
[15:06:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh i see
[15:06:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> also u saw the zombie right?
[15:06:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> yeah
[15:06:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> alr
[15:07:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wait a stack of iron alr
[15:07:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> this was set up last night
[15:07:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> so that is not very good
[15:07:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> how long did it take?
[15:07:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> very fast actually when flying
[15:08:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wait so u didnt make this legit...?
[15:08:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> when I did it with scaffolding only on my creative test world it took me 30 minutes
[15:08:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> bruh
[15:08:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no this isnt legit im going to break it when I'm done
[15:08:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> we should make this legit
[15:08:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh ok
[15:08:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> yeah this was never intended to be permanent
[15:08:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> should we time set day in order to rest the guy's sleep
[15:08:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> but sometimes the tick rate of servers changes things from what they would be singleplaer
[15:09:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no these villagers need to sleep
[15:09:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> eah
[15:09:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> there we go
[15:09:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wait they got oit
[15:09:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> they need to feel threatened
[15:09:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> there we go
[15:09:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> spruce doesnt burn
[15:09:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> sign?
[15:09:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> the sign?
[15:10:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> signs*
[15:10:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> spruce signs and fences dont burn
[15:10:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> fence gates do
[15:10:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> so for that we need to go to the Nether and get crimson wood
[15:10:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ah ok
[15:10:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> crimson dont brun either?
[15:10:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> yeah nether wood doesnt burn
[15:10:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah farm is working
[15:11:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> if I can get this to work this makes 4.5 iron/30 sec = 4200 iron/7 hour
[15:11:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> can u fix the water flood down there
[15:11:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> also wow thats A LOT OF IRON
[15:11:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> I measured yields earlier last night
[15:11:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> but everything broke
[15:12:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> its so jank the villagers dont seem to panic unless they slept
[15:12:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> or unless they're trying to sleep
[15:12:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> i dont understsnd it
[15:12:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> hm
[15:12:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah idk
[15:12:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> but as you can see this works just fine that aside
[15:13:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah
[15:13:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> like even though it's only 2 iron golems a minute that stacks really quickly
[15:13:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> def
[15:13:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> chest(s) will be full in no time
[15:14:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> if only I can get this prototype to work right
[15:14:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> then we can count materials and get to work on making it
[15:15:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> should i fly up and help
[15:15:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait for it to turn to day then lets see what happens
[15:15:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> alr
[15:15:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> also 3rd donkey
[15:15:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait why are you here?
[15:15:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> how put chest on it
[15:15:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> is it not school day?
[15:15:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah im in phys
[15:15:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> we're not doing anything
[15:15:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wdym how put chest on it
[15:15:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> how put chest in the donkey
[15:16:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> right click
[15:16:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> o ok
[15:17:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> sorry for making this without you it would have been frustrating though to debug this out live
[15:17:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> npnp we can build the real one
[15:17:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> this only works when it's like a gazillion blocks in the air or else iron golems spawn on the floor
[15:18:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> makes sense
[15:18:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> it will be frustrating to bus zombies and villagers up here
[15:18:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> i think we could use boast + successive piston
[15:18:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> boat
[15:19:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> piston elevator?
[15:19:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> why not water elevator?
[15:19:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> will they go up?
[15:19:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> if we do that soul sand thingy they will
[15:19:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> or like will it be easy to make? doesnt each block of water need to be source
[15:19:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> how do you make piston elevator?
[15:20:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> just piston the boat up, place block to side, boat onto that block, move piston up a block, boat onto piston again, piston up, repeat
[15:20:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> you can do that ill get frustrated
[15:21:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> we can actually prototype that rn
[15:21:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> it goes lightning fast with 2 ppl
[15:21:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> come up here and watch
[15:22:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> comin
[15:22:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> it takes a while hold on
[15:23:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> worked
[15:23:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait now with clear weather does this work
[15:23:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ye
[15:24:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> ?????
[15:24:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> what
[15:24:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> then why wasn't this working like, all night?
[15:25:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> idk
[15:26:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> what is it getting caught on
[15:26:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait look at this
[15:26:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> its standing on the door
[15:26:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wait what
[15:26:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ywah look im doing it
[15:27:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> i have no idea what im standing on
[15:27:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> what are you stadning on
[15:27:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> LMAO
[15:27:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> this block right here
[15:28:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh oyh
[15:28:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no
[15:29:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no it will just stand on the block
[15:29:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> it cant dude
[15:29:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> if you pillar it it cant
[15:29:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> lets try it
[15:30:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> can it fit thru the gap im in rn
[15:30:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no it's 1.5 blocks wide
[15:30:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok then its good
[15:30:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait why did they stop spawning
[15:31:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> does it need to be lit up
[15:31:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> the villagers need to sleep every day
[15:31:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> and they werent
[15:32:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> thats why it was breaking
[15:32:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> we have to have sticky pistons on a clock
[15:32:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> and why werent they sleeping
[15:32:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> how does that fix it
[15:32:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> because they felt threatened by the zombie
[15:32:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> if they feel threatened to they sleep or not sleep
[15:32:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> do
[15:32:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> they dont sleep
[15:32:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> come watch
[15:32:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> then why is zombie there
[15:33:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> y is zombie there
[15:33:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> as soon as the villagers "see" the zombie they get up
[15:33:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok but that means they cant sleep right
[15:33:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> so why do we have the zombie
[15:33:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> if they need to sleep
[15:33:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> so they feel threatened
[15:34:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> iron golems only spawn if they feel threatened
[15:34:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> you just said that makes them not sleep
[15:34:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> but they also need to sleep
[15:34:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh
[15:34:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> then wait how does the farm working then
[15:34:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> as you can see they spawned right after I made them sleep and get up
[15:34:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> how is the farm working then*
[15:34:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> i dunno
[15:34:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> oh
[15:34:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> uh the villagers slept for a split second
[15:34:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> then I made them scared again
[15:34:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh
[15:34:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> we need to have pistons on a clock
[15:34:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah
[15:35:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> sticky pistons that activate the blocks for a minute to let them get in bed, then take them away for about 20 minutes
[15:35:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> how did you make the piston clock down there
[15:35:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> is night + day 20 mins?
[15:35:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> the 1-wide hopper clock wouldnt work here because it sets consistent intervals
[15:35:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> we need 2 differing intervals here
[15:35:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> y
[15:35:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> keep the block up for 1 minute and away for 19
[15:36:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh i see
[15:36:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> to maximize iron production
[15:36:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> man this is so frustrating lowkey
[15:36:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> we can just replicate this one but twice
[15:37:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> this is a very fast build
[15:37:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> getting things into position is way harder
[15:37:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> as you can see it's just a ton of stone and glass
[15:37:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> very easy to make
[15:37:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> even the fences can just be cobble walls
[15:39:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wya
[15:39:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> tryan see how this clock works
[15:39:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> oh the 1-wide hopper clock?
[15:39:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> the pistons are sticky btw
[15:39:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> no its 6 wide
[15:39:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no 1-wide
[15:39:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh 1x6
[15:39:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wide refers to the least wide side
[15:40:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> comparator is going wrong wat
[15:41:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> hoppers dispense at 1 obj/s
[15:41:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> put in 1/2 # of s you want
[15:42:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> so min is 2s
[15:42:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> min is 30 objs
[15:42:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh so 60
[15:42:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> secs
[15:42:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> so put 30 dead bushes in a side
[15:44:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> do you see how the clock works?
[15:44:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> which hopper do i put the initial 30 into
[15:44:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> and why wont it work for under 30
[15:44:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> the side where the redstone block is initially
[15:45:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> the clock does work for under 30
[15:45:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> uh
[15:45:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> see
[15:45:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> pull the lever to turn the clock back on
[15:46:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wheres the dirt the dirt it gone
[15:46:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> i took it
[15:46:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> lever not working
[15:46:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh that way
[15:46:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> y dead bush?
[15:46:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> anything works
[15:46:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> i just like dead bush for the memes
[15:47:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok the time is half of what you put in
[15:47:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> hopper dispenses 2 items per second
[15:47:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> it does?
[15:47:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> i actually didnt know that
[15:48:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> that explains why the water is up longer than it takes to kill precisely 1 chicken
[15:48:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah i put 10 bush in, its a 5 second signal
[15:48:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> but there is your hopper clock
[15:48:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wait no its a 10s interval
[15:48:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> so however many u put in = the interval
[15:48:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> yeah it pushes the block back and forth
[15:48:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> in seconds
[15:48:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah
[15:49:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> so for up there we need to put in 20*60 = 1200
[15:49:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> we dont have enough space for that
[15:49:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> we could have a series of them tho?
[15:49:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no the issue is the uneven intervals
[15:49:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> we'll just have 2 running
[15:49:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> one lags 1 min behind the other
[15:49:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> ohhhhh I see
[15:50:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> thats so 5head
[15:50:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> or just a repeater ofshoot that'll time for 30s or so
[15:50:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> not 30s
[15:50:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> like 5s
[15:50:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> 5s is long enough?
[15:50:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> didn't you break/replace the block almost instantly
[15:50:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> and golems continued spwaning
[15:51:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> bruh itd be so much easier to build this with a mouse lmao
[15:51:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ima try make it
[15:51:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> make what?
[15:51:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> the clok
[15:51:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> hold on
[15:51:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> lets see if golems spawn
[15:51:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah it id
[15:51:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait how are they still spawning
[15:52:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> lets see that may have been residue
[15:52:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> we wait until they dont spawn anymore
[15:52:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> just to verify my theory
[15:52:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah
[15:52:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok 1 spawned
[15:53:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> omg this is like watching paint dry
[15:53:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> LMFAO
[15:53:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> redstone is so frustrating sometimes
[15:54:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> think it might have stopped
[15:54:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> has it been 1 minute?
[15:54:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh idk
[15:55:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> okay that is deffo 1 minute now they stopped
[15:55:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> okay my theory is right
[15:55:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> they have to sleep once a day
[15:55:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> lets try breaking/replacing blocks rly fast and see what happens
[15:55:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait
[15:55:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> lets see if just 2 villagers is enough
[15:56:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok 3rd guy didnt sleep
[15:56:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> yeah
[15:56:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> all 3 have to sleep
[15:56:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeap
[15:56:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> pistons through the bottom I think?
[15:56:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yup
[15:59:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> bruh its too close to piston
[15:59:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> yeah you have ot have the slimeblocks
[16:00:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ro[ zombie
[16:00:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> rip*
[16:00:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> forgot about that tbh
[16:00:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> uhhh an iron golem just spawned on the water
[16:01:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> thats suppoed to happen right
[16:01:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no like the water platform up
[16:01:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah
[16:01:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no like
[16:01:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> he one we use to get up
[16:01:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh
[16:01:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> anyways I need to go now to pack for stats
[16:01:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> cya
[16:01:51] [Server thread/INFO]: Cognizar lost connection: Disconnected
[16:01:51] [Server thread/INFO]: Cognizar left the game
[16:01:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> alr gl mate
