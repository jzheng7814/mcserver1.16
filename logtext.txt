[04:10:07] [Server thread/INFO]: Leucoptera joined the game
[04:10:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> hellooooo
[04:10:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> eyo watche doin
[04:10:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> trying to find the perfect amount of dead bushes
[04:10:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> for wht
[04:10:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> because I noticed that ~5 seconds after the villagers get scared, an iron golem spawns
[04:10:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> golem farm>?
[04:11:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> so if we can perfectly time it so that as soon as a golem dies the walls go up and down we can increase production
[04:11:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> i also noticed that the hopper flow will get slower if laggy
[04:12:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> so like it mght have an interval of more than 5*64 seconds
[04:12:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> it takes about 25-30 seconds for a golem to die
[04:12:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> could we use tripwire or smth to just make a repeater
[04:12:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> so if we time it so the walls go down right as the golem dies
[04:12:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> or like trip wire triggers repeater
[04:12:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait
[04:12:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wouldnt trip wire break?
[04:12:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> y?
[04:13:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> tripwire doesnt break on uasage
[04:13:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> or use pressure plate
[04:13:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> but like you see what I mean when I say right after the walls go down a golem spawns
[04:13:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> tripwire more coverage i think tho
[04:13:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> sure tripwire
[04:13:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> you know how to set that up?
[04:13:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah gimme a sec
[04:13:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> do we need to stop this?
[04:14:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> uh just block of golem temporarily
[04:15:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> btw I set up the whats is face
[04:15:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> we already have more than enough cobble
[04:15:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> makes about a stack a minute so it was fast
[04:15:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> how
[04:15:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> there we go
[04:16:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> does it work?
[04:16:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> well it activates on golem fall
[04:16:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> i unblocked the qwater
[04:16:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> lets see it
[04:16:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> we need to time a golem death
[04:16:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> no need
[04:16:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no because we need the walls to drop right as the golem dies
[04:17:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> we'll set up a followup signal with repeater, or the deactivation of the hook
[04:17:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah we can just hook it to deactivation of hook
[04:17:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> oh so walls up on hook activation, walls down on deactivation?
[04:17:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> you're a genius
[04:18:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok wtf caused that
[04:18:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> that was so clutch
[04:18:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> lol yeah
[04:18:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> breaking the pane that held all the signs up
[04:18:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> y it do that
[04:18:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh
[04:18:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> can u redo signs but with the cobble there?
[04:19:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> kill this golem
[04:19:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> last golem to spawn
[04:19:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> blocks up
[04:20:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> should I break the clock?
[04:20:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> hold on what block are the signs anchored on
[04:21:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> a cobble?
[04:21:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> BRUH I TRIED TO BREAK GLASS BUT IT BROKE SIGN
[04:22:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> sorry had to go for a sec
[04:22:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> why cobble?
[04:22:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> uh i had to hook a wire
[04:22:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> place a hook i mean
[04:22:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> cant do that on glass
[04:22:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait
[04:22:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> why did a zombie spawn on a fence
[04:22:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> i mean i only need the hook on the bottom block u can turn the rest into glass if u want
[04:23:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> okay I wanna see this though
[04:23:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> red activates
[04:23:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> alr both trips work?
[04:23:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> yes
[04:24:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> can I go ahead and destroy the clock?
[04:24:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> i think so yeah
[04:24:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> so when do walls come down and go up?
[04:24:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> conditions
[04:24:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> walls up on activation, walls down on deactivation
[04:25:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> kk
[04:25:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok i think that should work
[04:25:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> should I break this entire repeater delay?
[04:26:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh wait no
[04:26:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> why do u have two sticky pistons?
[04:26:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wont one do the job?
[04:26:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> where
[04:26:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> on the redstone block
[04:26:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> here let me try something
[04:26:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> no they were normal
[04:26:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> NO
[04:26:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait
[04:26:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> dude wait please
[04:26:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> let me try something
[04:27:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok just try this
[04:27:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> activate wall on golem fall, deactivate on goelm die
[04:27:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> you need to put a redstone torch in there
[04:27:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> theres still blockage
[04:28:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> there we go
[04:28:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> hmm maybe a slight delay would help
[04:29:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> delay on both conditions?
[04:29:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> yeah why not
[04:29:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> that just means more repeater
[04:30:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> maybe even longer delay
[04:30:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait
[04:30:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> why dont we just
[04:31:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> long enough>
[04:31:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ?
[04:31:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> seems like it
[04:31:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> but no spawn
[04:31:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> seems like there's a hard 30 second cap on spawning golems
[04:31:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh wait
[04:31:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah
[04:32:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> still this seems to max out that cap
[04:32:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wanna set it to close to night and see what happen
[04:32:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> one is spawning exactly every 30 seconds
[04:32:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok it work
[04:33:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> bro and we get rid of the clock which was at best a guess at the right timing
[04:33:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> and we get the exact right timing
[04:33:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> nice
[04:33:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> you are so 5head pranav
[04:33:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> i would have never thought of the tripwires
[04:33:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> lmao ty
[04:34:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> average 4/golem
[04:34:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> that'd stack pretty qwuickly
[04:34:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> also all the roses :_)
[04:35:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> 4 iron/golem * 2 golem/min * 60 min / h * 7 h = 3360 ingots overnight
[04:35:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> holy crap
[04:35:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> iron galore
[04:35:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> make a note of the amount of repeaters, important positions, etc
[04:38:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> sry afl
[04:38:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> okay lets count
[04:38:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> ill count blocks you count glass
[04:38:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> can we just say stack of glass
[04:38:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> leftover ok right
[04:38:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> we'll def have misplacements n stuff
[04:38:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> 7x7x2 + 3x7 = 98 + 21 = 119
[04:38:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> we will have way too much cobble
[04:38:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> of what
[04:39:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> thats a cobble ledge
[04:39:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> needs to be glass pane
[04:39:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wiat look at this
[04:39:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> NO IT TRAMPLED A WHEAT FIELD
[04:39:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> NO THEY RUINED ONE OF THE CROP BLOCKS
[04:39:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> lmao jinx
[04:39:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> this has to be glass pane
[04:40:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> y
[04:40:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> or else they get caught on the lip
[04:40:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok
[04:40:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> no now the can get caught on lip
[04:40:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> like this
[04:40:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> they are 1.5 wide they dont fit in that lip

[04:41:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> how about we... pull the hook block out 1?
[04:41:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> this is ok
[04:41:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> so that lip doesnt exist?
[04:41:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> hm I'd say 2 stacks of glass just to be on the safe side
[04:42:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> why cant u just make the cobble like i had it?
[04:42:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> alr^

[21:16:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> call in several hard raids until the golems and villagers are dead
[21:17:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no because of the iron golems
[21:17:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> they wont spawn because there are already 7 walking around
[21:18:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> so i look up and saw that zombie has to pick up armor on its won but it's random
[21:18:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> bruh
[21:18:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ie. zsome zombies can pick up, some cant

[21:20:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> i just arbitratily picked the armorless one cause i wanted the fun of putting the armor onto him
[21:20:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> i COULD hav eeasily trapped the leather one instead
[21:20:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> okay yeah thats fair

[17:15:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> cats in the corners increase stuff with the creepers
[17:15:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> thats good right...?
[17:15:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> ideally a turtle egg will cause zombies to run towards it
[17:15:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> more creepers = more gunpow
[17:15:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> but it doesnt seem to work properly
[17:15:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> just remove it
[17:15:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> its good enough
[17:15:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no this is important because the wither skeleton farm working hinges on undead running towards turtle eggs
[17:15:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah that happens
[17:16:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> we dont need it in this mob farm though
[17:16:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> but then why arent they running towards it>
[17:16:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> try it somewhere else
[17:16:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> maybe hmm

[19:44:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> sure
[19:45:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> for the wither fight
[19:45:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> may even increase size
[19:45:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> can we just go far away and fight it
[19:45:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> no because then itll just fly and that gets annoying
[19:46:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> you have to contain it
[19:46:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> alternatively, we can do this in the end
[19:46:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> once it agtgros onto you it doesn't un-agro tho
[19:46:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> but it flies and as I said that gets irritating
[19:46:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> bow
[19:46:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cognizar> you want to keep it somewhat boxed in
[19:46:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> our bows are insane

[19:50:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> lets just foo 300 blocks away from here
[19:50:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Leucoptera> amnd fight it
