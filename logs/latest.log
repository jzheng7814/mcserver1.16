[05:01:41] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> ey
[05:01:47] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Leucoptera> hey
[05:02:04] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> currently in nether finishing up a patch of build
[05:02:14] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> can you fly around and try to find an area with a lot of animals
[05:02:19] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Leucoptera> its night
[05:02:27] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> take the wither spawning materials with me, then tp me to u when done
[05:02:29] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> oh just slee
[05:02:43] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh ok i thought u wer here
[05:02:51] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> oh no im in the nether
[05:03:10] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh yeah the ice farm created a death pit under it; stand close and youll have creeper/zombie swarm around u
[05:03:23] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> lmao yeah I noticed that
[05:03:30] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> invis pots pro when placing beacons
[05:03:36] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Leucoptera> tru tru
[05:03:56] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Leucoptera> what if we just make a cow farm or pig farm or smth
[05:04:04] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> you can do that sure
[05:04:09] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Leucoptera> thats like hundreds of entities
[05:04:09] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> but itll be annoying to wait
[05:04:13] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wdym?
[05:04:17] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh yah
[05:04:26] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> this is a one time thing
[05:04:32] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> i almost never use roses in my builds
[05:04:35] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> just need 15 more roses
[05:04:53] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Leucoptera> well it sbetter than flying for who know how long trying to find a bunch of animals together
[05:05:06] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> hmm
[05:05:27] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> i mean realistically i think baby animals drop roses too so you only need like
[05:05:40] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> 10 animals, breed em and you get 5 more
[05:05:45] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> and that gives you 15 roses
[05:06:33] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Leucoptera> do chimkins work
[05:06:37] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> yes
[05:06:38] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> any mob
[05:06:55] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> chickens actually work better because they get 1hked in an explosion
[05:07:04] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> if they die to wither effect but not mob no rose
[05:07:16] [Async Chat Thread - #0/INFO]: <Cognizar> yes
[05:12:36] [Server thread/INFO]: Leucoptera issued server command: /time set day
[05:15:45] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait are you doing this close to base?
[05:15:57] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Leucoptera> vill2, but i will mvoe the chickens out
[05:16:00] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Cognizar> kk
[05:16:06] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Cognizar> how many?
[05:16:17] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Leucoptera> so will baby chickens work as well
[05:16:38] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ?
[05:16:47] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Cognizar> apparently not
[05:16:53] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Leucoptera> only adults?
[05:16:57] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Cognizar> you can feed them seeds to make them grow faster though
[05:20:24] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Cognizar> this farms rates is trash
[05:20:28] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Cognizar> a stack an hour of afk
[05:20:33] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Cognizar> ah its good enough for us
[05:20:39] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Leucoptera> i mean yeah its good enough i think
[05:20:55] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Cognizar> yeah you only need 5 to respawn the dragon
[05:20:55] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Leucoptera> fed over 2 stacks of seeds to babies, waiting for them to grow
[05:21:20] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Cognizar> just wait, itll happen sooner or later
[05:21:27] [Server thread/INFO]: Leucoptera issued server command: /time set 0
[05:21:33] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Leucoptera> moving all of them away from vilage
[05:21:38] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Cognizar> alternatively, we can fight the wither at night
[05:23:12] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Cognizar> you might wanna spend a bit building obsidian barriers and setups because outside wither is brutal
[05:25:10] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ho wbig/thick
[05:25:16] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> uhhhh
[05:25:25] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> how big depends on how the wither flies
[05:25:28] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Leucoptera> also will chickens despawn if i go away
[05:25:29] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> it may require some chasing
[05:25:43] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> I don't believe they will, no
[05:26:39] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Leucoptera> how big room
[05:26:45] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> for what
[05:26:50] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Leucoptera> obsidian walls
[05:26:57] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> walls dont matter
[05:27:03] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> remember this thing breaks obsidian
[05:27:06] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Leucoptera> you jsut said make walls
[05:27:09] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Leucoptera> out of obs
[05:27:14] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> just something to hide behind as we snipe the wither
[05:27:21] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> scattered around an area on the plains
[05:27:31] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Leucoptera> huh
[05:27:35] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> sorry I could have been more clear
[05:27:50] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> just build like small 3x3 walls around the plain where we can duck behind to shoot the wither while taking cover
[05:28:06] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ah ok
[05:28:16] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Leucoptera> will roses not blow up?
[05:28:23] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> yeah
[05:28:29] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> they're wither-proof
[05:29:12] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok im ready
[05:29:20] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> kk tp me
[05:29:36] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Leucoptera> idk how many adults there are we can go grab pots while the rest grow
[05:29:40] [Server thread/INFO]: Leucoptera issued server command: /tp Cognizar Leucoptera
[05:29:52] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> no I stay to keep chunks loaded
[05:29:56] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> you can go
[05:30:13] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <Cognizar> bring a totem just in case

[05:32:09] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <Cognizar> you ready?
[05:32:43] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <Cognizar> spawn the wither in the chicken pit
[05:32:50] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <Cognizar> wait can u tp me out
[05:32:50] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <Leucoptera> the explosion will kill them

[05:33:15] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <Cognizar> it doesnt have to, just the wither kiling them
[05:33:18] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <Cognizar> (I think
[05:33:23] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <Cognizar> we can spawn, throw at base
[05:33:29] [Server thread/INFO]: Cognizar issued server command: /give Cognizar soul_sand 4
[05:33:29] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <Leucoptera> i forgot to get

[05:33:59] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <Leucoptera> go
[05:35:14] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <Cognizar> 29 wither roses pog
[05:35:18] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <Cognizar> def enough
[05:35:21] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <Leucoptera> i got one rose
[05:35:34] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <Cognizar> these roses are great for farms
[05:35:50] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <Cognizar> but not worth making a 1.3k/h farm that we will use for 10 minutes then never use again
[05:35:58] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <Leucoptera> yeah
[05:36:59] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> time to finish this thing
[05:37:01] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> wanna help?
[05:37:08] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> finish what, the farm? sure
[05:38:03] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> wya
[05:38:12] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wYa?

[05:38:26] [Server thread/INFO]: Cognizar issued server command: /give Cognizar redstone_torch 23
[05:38:28] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> why so close to path
[05:38:30] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> oop too many
[05:38:43] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> uhhh why not
[05:38:45] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> lazy
[05:38:55] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wont ghasts aim and blow at us
[05:39:08] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> we are on ice boats
[05:39:24] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> but they rcognize the player, and shoot, the fireball will land on and destroy the path
[05:39:26] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> can you finish the glass wall around the farm
[05:39:35] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> see chat^
[05:39:47] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> they wont be able to target that quick (I think)
[05:39:54] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> besides this farms spawn rate is trash
[05:40:04] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> they target while i zip past on elytras thru soul sand valley
[05:40:12] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> theres nothing stopping them from doing same on ice boats
[05:40:24] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> we'll cross that bridge when we come to it
[05:40:47] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> we alr at that brdige mate, u want to cross it while its on fire
[05:41:02] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> i live dangerously
[05:41:52] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> srsly tho let me structure block move it
[05:41:59] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> after we finish
[05:42:00] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> i dont want to repair the ice boat
[05:42:10] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> nah after finish, ghasts will alre spawn
[05:42:16] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> sure fine
[05:42:20] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> let me do now rq
[05:42:21] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> gives me time to read final step as is
[05:42:24] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> pick a good spot
[05:42:30] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> or shoul di just move it somwehre
[05:42:40] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> this farm can realistically be moved anywhere in the soul sand valley
[05:42:47] [Server thread/INFO]: Leucoptera issued server command: /gamemode creative
[05:43:36] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> wait how do you collect the stuff from the chests if there are ghasts right there
[05:44:07] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> huh
[05:44:10] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> they cant see you
[05:44:28] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> or just bow them
[05:44:32] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> then why is going by on an ice boat a worry
[05:44:40] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> no like they will keep spawning, yes?
[05:44:43] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> its not a worry lol
[05:44:55] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> bro what is stopping the chests from getting blown up
[05:45:06] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> if ur so worried we can make the walls on the ice path for this section 2 tall
[05:45:13] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> so the ghasts dont make LOS with us
[05:45:27] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> what stops them from blowing u up as you colelct materials from chest
[05:45:47] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> kill them first, then they can't spawn close to you...?
[05:46:01] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> oh ok
[05:46:27] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> and the easier solution would just be to 2-high the walls on this stretch
[05:46:44] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> right
[05:46:55] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Leucoptera> inconvenient to get out and run around for any purpose at all
[05:47:04] [Server thread/INFO]: Leucoptera issued server command: /give Leucoptera minecraft:structure_block
[05:47:17] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> include the redstone torches
[05:47:24] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> bro how about this
[05:47:30] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> we first see if this creates any issues at all
[05:47:42] [Async Chat Thread - #7/INFO]: <Cognizar> because I significantly doubt it will
[05:50:10] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <Leucoptera> loaded, move it?
[05:50:30] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <Leucoptera> ok as u said lets test here then
[05:50:38] [Server thread/INFO]: Leucoptera issued server command: /gamemode sur
[05:50:39] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <Cognizar> afk spot isnt even built
[05:50:48] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <Cognizar> argh forgot to get scaffolding
[05:50:54] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <Leucoptera> will move meanwhile then
[05:51:02] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <Cognizar> waut
[05:51:07] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <Cognizar> dont remove all these extra blocks
[05:51:22] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <Leucoptera> do u see the outline
[05:51:26] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <Cognizar> no
[05:51:27] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <Leucoptera> evth in outline is copied over

[05:51:38] [Server thread/INFO]: Cognizar issued server command: /gamemode creative
[05:51:41] [Async Chat Thread - #8/INFO]: <Cognizar> now I do
[05:53:16] [Async Chat Thread - #9/INFO]: <Leucoptera> copied
